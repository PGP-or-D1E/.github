# .github

A home for our [default community health files](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-default-community-health-file-for-your-organization) (eg contributing guidelines, issue templates). These will show up by default in any of our public-facing repositories -- unless said repositories have overriden this behavior by adding their own community files.
